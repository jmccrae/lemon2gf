* A-Box (pos=properNoun)
* Templates for: ditransitive verbs, prepositions, adjectives
* Templates for other languages
* allow for lists of singular and plural values
* markers are currently assumed to be prepositions, extend this to cases
* filter opers for those already defined in resource grammar


Think about:

* decompositions (and type safety on the GF side)
* restrictions (lemon:condition)
* NounDefault template: np = mkNP (mkCN name_N) in case of mass nouns

Implementation details:

* error handling (reject and report entries that throw an error)
* provide setup for installation
* if sparql/meta/* was changed, run query generation


Future:

* get lexical information from Wiktionariy mappings if necessary
