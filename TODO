* A-Box 
* Templates for: ditransitive verbs, prepositions, adjectives
* also: frames for general lemon:Frame, e.g. for multivalent nouns
* make sure and document that templates cover John's lemon patterns
* allow for lists of singular and plural values
* filter opers for those already defined in resource grammar


Think about:

* decompositions (and type safety on the GF side)
* restrictions (lemon:condition)


Implementation details:

* error handling
* provide setup for installation
* if sparql/meta/* was changed, run query generation


Future:

* get lexical information from Wiktionariy mappings if necessary
